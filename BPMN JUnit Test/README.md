This is my JUNIT testing for BPMN.
Scope of the test
I have completed this JUnit test to determine if the stock available on the information system is greater than 0 so that the stock is available and less than or equal to 0 so the stock isn't available. If the stock is greater than 0 it will lead to a success path for the test with the test passing but if the stock is less than or equal to 0 it will lead to the fail path.
